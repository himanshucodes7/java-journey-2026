# Java Journey 2026 🚀

This repository documents my complete Java learning journey starting from January 28, 2026.

My goals:
- Master Java from zero to advanced
- Build strong programming fundamentals
- Prepare for real-world interviews
- Maintain daily consistency

Structure:
- Each folder represents a topic or day
- Code is written, tested, and pushed daily
- Clean and beginner-friendly code

This is not just practice.  
This is proof of discipline and growth.
